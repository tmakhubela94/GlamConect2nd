Welcome to our Group Capstone Project! Our team has undertaken the task of building a landing page for the "GlamConnect" app, an innovative online marketplace that revolutionizes the beauty service industry by connecting service providers with clients, akin to the model of Uber but tailored for beauty services. For a clearer understanding, you can refer to similar concepts like GlamSquad.
